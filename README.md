# reporting_app

Built using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for the backend, NISHTHA enables secure, real-time task assignments and report submissions. The application supports multiple roles — General Manager, Head of Department, Chief Manager, Manager, and Worker — with each user redirected to a customized dashboard based on their designation. Task creation, deadline management, report submission, and role-specific access controls are key features of the app. Firebase Firestore ensures scalable data storage while Firebase Authentication provides secure user management.
